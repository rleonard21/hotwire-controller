# Hotwire Controller
### An AVR-based power supply for cutting foam.
[See the newest revision of the project here!](https://github.com/rleonard21/hotwire-lite)

### The circuit
I designed the circuit using Autodesk Eagle and had the PCB manufactured by AllPCB in China. The circuit is described in detail in `hardware.md`. The current hardware revision is `v1.1`, which improved on `v1.0`'s power stage and LCD functionality. Below is an image of the current `v1.1` hardware without the LCD installed.

I also machined an enclosure to house the circuit. The image below is the completed product.

### Results
I designed this tool to help me build a large model airplane. Here's part of the fuselage. The pink foam was cut using my hotwire controller. The complex shapes were achieved by laser-cut wood stencils.

A partially cut cross-section of the fuselage. Note the visible wire dangling from the center and the smooth cuts achieved by the hotwire.

A fully cut cross-section of the fuselage. This single piece is very light and stiff, which will make the perfect core for a fiberglass composite outer shell.

A partially assembled fuselage. The individual slices of the fuselage are aligned using four aluminum rods, which will be removed after the slices are bonded together.
