# Hardware Task List

* LED for blinking purposes
    * Will help with debugging the AVR
    * Put on an empty port probably
    * Place near an edge on the board


* ISCP headers
    * Best if at right angle and exposed towards left/right
    * Could also work vertically if enough space on circuit


* Temperature sensor
    * Figure out if it's necessary
    * Determine how it mounts (separate PCB?)
    * Figure out the wiring harness and connector


## Hardware Design
* Model the XT60 pads in Eagle
* Pick LED SMD size and put into schematic/board
* Double check the dimensions of the board fit the enclosure
* Double check the LCD
* Do a good job determining component placement, starting with physical limitations
* Route the traces
